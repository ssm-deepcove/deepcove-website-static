                        The hostel offers three walks that cater to the needs of most visitors. One of these include the
                        Hanging Valley Track which is a challenge for school students, while the second gives access to
                        the
                        Helena Falls on the opposite side of Doubful Sound and the third, is the old Doubtful Sound
                        Track
                        that follows the lower part of the original walking track.

                        An easy 20 minutes nature walk, starting at the eastern end of the Hostel and finishing on the
                        Wilmot Pass Road, just south of the hostel. A natural history questionnaire is available at the
                        Hostel for school groups. This track is a useful starting point to a camp, as it provides an
                        early introduction to the flora and fauna of the area.

                        This track now starts at the swing bridge on the road to the tunnel portal. From the hostel walk
                        over the hill and turn left to cross over the Lyvia River. The start of the track is on the left
                        about 200 meters from the Lyvia bridge. The new swing bridge was built at a cost of $120,000
                        (2009) with the cost being met by the generosity of Meridian Energy, Department of Conservation
                        and the Deep Cove Hostel Trust. (Trust money donated by the Southern Trust).<br><br>

                        After crossing the bridge a loop track of some 40 minutes duration provides access to the stream
                        at the base of Helena Falls and in good weather the base of the falls. This stream may prevent
                        parties reaching the base of the falls in wet weather, however the view of the falls is worth
                        the effort. The walk provides good opportunities to study the regeneration of the bush, some of
                        which was planted out in stages during the building of the 2nd tunnel and some has self seeded.
                        The start of this track is only a short distance from the start of and can be included in the
                        Old Doubtful Sound Track /Stella Falls walk consideration needs to be given to the fitness of
                        your group before doing so.

                        This track is the remains of the original Doubtful Sound walking track, used as access to
                        Doubtful Sound before the Wilmot Pass road was built.<br><br>

                        From the tail-race portal the track leads up the valley on the true right of the Lyvia River to
                        a swing bridge (The old bridge was replaced in 1998 at a cost of approx $30,000.) over the
                        Stella Burn. It then gains more height to meet the Deep Cove/West Arm road approximately a third
                        of the way up to the Wilmot Pass.<br><br>

                        This track is considered by many to be the most beautiful track, close to the hostel. Small
                        water falls partially hidden in the bush can be seen on the lower part of the track, along with
                        views of the Lyvia River and the Stella Burn.<br><br>

                        While the track is generally up hill, it is not really steep and the footing is generally good.

                        This is a steep and sometimes muddy track, but it has worthwhile views of Deep Cove. The track
                        starts behind the Hostel Managers house, across the road from the Hostel. It follows up the true
                        right of the Wanganella Stream to an open area of smooth rock. The track proceeds on up the
                        valley to the base of the Huntleigh Falls. Care must be taken when coming down this track, due
                        to slippery tree roots and the steep track. Students should be clearly warned to resist the urge
                        to run down this track.<br><br>

                        All of these tracks provide different experiences and opportunities to study the bush and
                        experience the wonders of being outdoors. With the exception of the Hanging Valley track all
                        tracks have the ability to be intercepted by a vehicle should anyone injure themselves or
                        perhaps tackle something greater than their physical abilty allowed.
